This is a conversion of the Random Number Generator guitar effects pedal that was laid out by storyboardist, found here:

https://effectslayouts.blogspot.com/2020/10/mid-fi-electronics-random-number.html

I have converted the images to a KiCad project so that one can send the gerbers to a PCB manufacturing service.

Please note that the files have yet to be manufactured, beware! But I think everything should be fine.

The KiCad project is availabe should you want to do something with it.

The gerbers zip is located in the "production" folder.
