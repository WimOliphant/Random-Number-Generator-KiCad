This is a conversion of the Random Number Generator guitar effects pedal that was laid out by storyboardist, found here:

https://effectslayouts.blogspot.com/2020/10/mid-fi-electronics-random-number.html

I have converted the images to a KiCad project so that one can send the gerbers to a PCB manufacturing service.

Please note that the files have yet to be manufactured, beware! But I think everything should be fine...

The KiCad project is availabe should you want to do something with it.

The gerbers zip is located in the "production" folder.

3D preview from KiCad.

The hand-draw silkscreen was done in GIMP.
